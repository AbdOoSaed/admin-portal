# Invoice Ninja - Mobile

This is a companion app for the [Invoice Ninja](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja) web app.

The project is in the very early stages of development, for the time being we recommend using the existing [mobile apps](https://www.invoiceninja.com/iphone-android/).

The application architecture is based off these two projects:
- [Redux Sample](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/example/redux) - [Brian Egan](https://twitter.com/brianegan)
- [inKino](https://github.com/roughike/inKino) - [Iiro Krankka](https://twitter.com/koorankka)

We gladly accept contributions! If you'd like to get involved with development please join our [Slack group](http://slack.invoiceninja.com/).
